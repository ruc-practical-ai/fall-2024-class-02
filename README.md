# Fall 2024 Class 02 - Brief History Review and Class References

This repository provides a brief review of important papers and milestones in modern AI, and serves as a study guide for key terms.

## Installation

### Use via Github Codespaces (Recommended)

To use this repository via codespaces simply click on the `code` &rarr; `codespaces` &rarr; `create codespace on main` buttons.

Once the codespace is open in the browser, click the three bars in the top left corner and select `Open in VS Code Desktop`.

Widgets might work better when using VS Code Desktop vs. in the browser.

Note the codespace might take a long time to build. This is usually due to texlive dependencies. Use `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` &rarr; `Codespaces: View Creation Logs` to check status.

If required, use `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` &rarr; `Codespaces: Rebuild Container` to rebuild the container. Do not use `gh codespace rebuild`. This takes a long time since it re-downloads the entire image.

### Dependencies for Local Installation

This project is built on Python 3.12. Poetry is required for installation. To install Poetry, view the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

In codespaces, Poetry installation is handled in the development container. The user does not need to install Poetry if working in codespaces.

### Local Installation

To install locally, first install the required dependencies (Poetry and texlive), then clone the repository and navigate to its directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruc-practical-ai/fall-2024-class-02.git
cd fall-2024-class-01
```

Configure Poetry to install its virtual environment inside the repository directory.

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Install the repository's Python dependencies.

```bash
poetry install --no-root
```

Check where Poetry built the virtual environment with the following command.

```bash
poetry env info --path
```

Open the command pallette with `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and type `Python: Select Interpreter`.

Now specify that VSCode should use the that interpreter (the one in `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe`). Once you specify this, Jupyter notebooks should show the project's interpreter as an option when you click the `kernel` icon or the small icon showing the current version of python (e.g., `Python 3.12.1`) and then click `Select Another Kernel`, and finally click `Python Environments...`.

## Usage

To use this repository, explore and click through the Jupyter notebooks.
